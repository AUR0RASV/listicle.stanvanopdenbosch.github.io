              The ASG Sportline Armalite series guns are not new by any means but deserve to be here just because of how good they are for the money. 
              For at or around $200 these guns are a perfect gun for a beginner yet the response and rate of fire feel like that of a more expensive gun. 
              They sound good and shoot smooth out of the box, much better than their peers in this price range.

            <div class = "paragraph-break-a"> </div>

            <p class = "item-text">
              The tight bore out of the box makes it more accurate, the gearbox has a QD spring guide so swapping springs for the desired velocity is easy enough.

              The motor is a nice torque motor out of the box and is better than some of the ones I have found in $400 guns, believe it or not. 
              The Light Tactical Carbine and MLOK Defense are going to be the same inside except that the MLOK Defense adds a programmable MOSFET.

              A MOSFET offers electronic protection for the switch assembly which tends to wear out faster if you are a Lipo battery user. 
              The MOSFET in this gun is also programmable so you can set the different fire modes to your liking.

                With a beautiful build and solid body, the EVO 3 BET carbine is about the same length as an M4. 
                While not a completely new model (the BET carbine is built on the A1 design) it comes with great improvements 
                such as the longer outer barrel and MLOK handguard (for better grip and more cool accessories).
              </p>
              <div class = "paragraph-break-a"> </div>

              <p class = "item-text">
                The cool thing with this EVO Carbine is that it features a full-metal internal system (not that common in medium-level airsoft guns). 
                This is why everything sounds and feels so good, and why the weight is just right. The electronically controlled metal gearbox is designed to deliver advanced functions and send the BBs flying out at high speed (about 425 FPS). 
                The EVO 3 BET is highly accurate (with the right Hop Up adjustments, of course) and it shoots well from over 50m.

              <div class = "paragraph-break-a"> </div>

              <p class = "item-text">
                Other cool features are the Actual 3 Round Burst (which is not new but now works flawlessly) and the Automated Internal Failure Detection 
                (so you don’t continue shooting when your airsoft gun has an internal problem). Even more, for ease of use, this EVO carbine comes with front and rear sights (which can be removed) and ambidextrous controls.

                  With a modern spin on a classic gun, this M4 version with a 13-inches Keymod rail system features impressive internals. 
                  The rifle has a fully metallic Version 2 gearbox (rear-wired), adjustable BAXS system hop up, and can fire at up to 350 FPS. 
                  It’s also one of the easiest lose quarters combat airsoft rifles to upgrade because the gearbox is compatible with Tokyo Marui and there are plenty of aftermarket parts for both the internals and the externals.

                <div class = "paragraph-break"> </div>

                <p class = "item-text">
                  The externals feature a full metallic build for the lower and upper receiver. 
                  The Keymod rail RIS system is fully equipped for all types of accessories and helps improve the grip and general weight of the gun. 
                  It comes equipped with two 350 BB Metal High Capacity magazines, it has an adjustable Hop-Up, and supports two firing modes: Semi-Auto and Full Auto.

                  I also like the flip-up iron sights (adjustable for both windage and elevation) that allow for the installation of other optics using the Picatinny rail on top 
                  (easy to install on most airsoft guns). Also, the stock can be lengthened or compressed as needed and is housing the nunchuck battery (9.6V, NiMH). To get to the battery, 
                  you’ll have to remove the butt plate (which is rubber) by pressing two small hooks that keep it attached to the body.

                    There’s no way I can make a list of the best airsoft guns and not mention at least one version of the legendary AK47! This is one of the most realistic AKs on the market, 
                    right now. It comes with a nylon fiber handguard, pistol grip, and stock (just like the real-steel version) and the rest of the body is all steel. 
                    As you can imagine, such materials aren’t lightweight so the final airsoft rifle is quite heavy in your hands. However, if you know what you’re doing, this is a wonderful, durable weapon.

                      The WELL L96 bolt action spring-powered sniper rifle features a durable polymer body and comes with a full metal inner and outer barrel assembly.
